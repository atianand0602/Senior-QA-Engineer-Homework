# Senior-QA-Engineer-Homework
***Overview***
This project(Sr_QA_Eng_HomeWork) is my submission for the QA Engineer Homework. It includes: Test Plan for an action camera. Practical Coding Solution, implementing one of the two given options: Alphanumeric Sort (Sorting numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters).

***Test Plan for Action Camera***
The test plan is included as an Excel file (\Sr_QA_Eng_HomeWork\src\TestPlan\Test Plan for Action Camera\Test Plan for Action Camera.xlsx). It contains 15 test cases covering: Power button functionality Battery life Water resistance (up to 100m) Drop resistance (up to 15m) File storage & low battery warnings Overheating & connectivity tests


**Design Decisions & Trade-offs Test Plan Format:**
Excel for easy sorting & tracking Trade-off: Could have used a Markdown table, but Excel allows better filtering.
Alphanumeric Sort Approach: Uses ArrayList for categorization and Collections.sort() for sorting. Trade-off: A custom comparator could improve efficiency but would increase complexity.
